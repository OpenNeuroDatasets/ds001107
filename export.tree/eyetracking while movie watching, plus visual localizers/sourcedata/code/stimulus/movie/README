Stimulus creation and verification
==================================

This folder contains scripts and data files to generate the stimulus videos and
to verify them. Timing verification can be done by comparing the timing of cuts
in the movie:

`mk_movie_stimulus.sh`:
  Script to generate the stimulus segment videos, given a DVD/Blueray stream.

`segment_timing.csv`:
  Table specifying the temporal position of all 8 stimulus movie segments with
  respect to the (research-)cut full movie time series.

`cuts_wholemovie.csv`:
  Table identifying all cuts (time and start frame of the following shot) in
  the unsegmented movie time series.

`cuts_segment*.csv`:
  Analog to `cuts_wholemovie.csv`, but with timing and cuts for each movie
  segment seperately.
